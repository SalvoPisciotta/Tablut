# TablutChallenge2020
**Tablut** is an ancient board game which was popular in nothern Europe and whose story is still uncertain.
During the course of Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence and Knowledge Representation we have designed a little prototype of an intelligent agent able to play to the game.
The agent is based on one of the many versions of the rules for this game, known as "Ashton Tablut", available in this [paper](http://ww.aagenielsen.dk/LinnaeusPaper-Longer.pdf).
